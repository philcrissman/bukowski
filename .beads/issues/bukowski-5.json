  "description": "Add define or defun (Scheme/Lisp-style) as an alternative to let for defining named functions and values. let should remain available. Consider: should define be sugar for let, or should it introduce a top-level environment that persists across REPL expressions? Scheme's define mutates the environment, which would be a bigger change than pure desugaring.",
